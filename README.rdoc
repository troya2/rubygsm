RubyGSM is a Ruby library which uses ruby-serialport[http://github.com/toholio/ruby-serialport]
to provide a nifty interface to send and receive SMS messages via a GSM modem.


=== Sample Usage
	
  class ReverseApp
      def initialize(gsm)
          gsm.receive(method(:incoming))
          @gsm = gsm
      end
      
      def incoming(message)
          @gsm.send(message.sender, message.text.reverse)
      end
  end

  gsm = GsmModem.new
  ReverseApp.new(gsm)


=== Installing
RubyGSM is distributed via GitHub[http://github.com/adammck/rubygsm], which you must
add as a gem source before installing:

  $ sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

The library depends upon ruby-serialport, which is currently maintained on GitHub by
Toholio[http://github.com/toholio/ruby-serialport]. This library is included as a Gem
dependancy, so to install both:

  $ sudo gem install adammck-rubygsm


==== For Debian/Ubuntu users...
The ruby-serialport library is available in the APT repository as a binary package, which
is substatially less hassle to install than the Gem, for those who don't have a compiler
installed (I prefer not to, on production servers). To install the package via apt, and
ignore the Gem dependancy:

  $ sudo apt-get install libserialport-ruby
  $ sudo gem install --ignore-dependencies adammck-rubygsm
